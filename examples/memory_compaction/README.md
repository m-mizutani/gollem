# Memory Compaction Example

This example demonstrates how to use gollem's history compaction feature to efficiently manage memory usage and token count during long conversations.

## Features

- **Automatic History Compaction**: Automatically compacts history when token thresholds are exceeded
- **In-Execute Compaction**: Checks for history compaction during Execute execution
- **Compaction Hook**: Monitor compaction events with detailed logging
- **Customizable Thresholds**: Configure when compaction should trigger

## How to Run

```bash
# Set OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Run the example
go run main.go
```

## Configuration Options

### Compaction Settings

```go
// Create history compactor with custom options
compactor := gollem.NewHistoryCompactor(llmClient,
    gollem.WithMaxTokens(10000),           // Start compaction at 10k tokens
    gollem.WithPreserveRecentTokens(3000)) // Preserve 3k tokens of recent context

// Enable automatic compaction
agent := gollem.New(llmClient,
    gollem.WithHistoryCompactor(compactor),
    gollem.WithHistoryCompaction(true),
    gollem.WithCompactionHook(compactionHook))
```

### How Compaction Works

- **Summarization**: Old messages are summarized to preserve context while reducing token count
- **Recent Message Preservation**: Recent messages are kept intact to maintain conversation flow
- **Automatic Triggers**: Compaction occurs when token thresholds are exceeded

## Expected Output

```
=== History Compaction Demo ===
Compaction settings: MaxTokens=10000, PreserveRecentTokens=3000
