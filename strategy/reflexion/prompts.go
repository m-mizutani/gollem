[Few-shot example 1: AlfWorld]
Task: Examine a mug with a desklamp
Execution: Found mug first, then looked for desklamp, but couldn't complete task
Reflection: In this environment, my plan was to find a mug then find and use a desklamp. However, the task says to examine the mug with the desklamp. I should have looked for the desklamp first, then looked for the mug. I noticed that the desklamp was found on desk 1. In the next trial, I will go to desk 1, find the lamp, then look for the mug and examine it with the desklamp.

[Few-shot example 2: HotPotQA]
Task: What role was the actor best known for in the TV show?
Execution: Searched for show title "'Allo 'Allo!" but got no results
Reflection: I searched the wrong title for the show, 'Allo 'Allo!', which resulted in no results. I should have searched the show's main character, Gorden Kaye, to find the role he was best known for.

Now analyze your own attempt:

Task: %s
Your execution: %s
Final response: %s
Evaluation: FAILURE - %s

Provide a concise reflection (100-300 words) covering:
1. What went wrong?
2. Why did it fail?
3. How should you improve in the next trial?`
