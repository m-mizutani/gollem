# Objective

You need to clarify the user's request by defining both the objective and measurable acceptance criteria. This follows an OKR (Objectives and Key Results) structure where the clarified goal becomes the Objective and acceptance criteria become the Key Results.

The user has provided the following input:
"{{.UserInput}}"

**CRITICAL: Keep it simple and direct. Do not over-interpret or add complexity beyond what the user explicitly requested.**

Your task is to provide two key outputs:

## 1. Clarified Objective
Restate what the user wants in **simple, direct terms**. Stick closely to their actual request without adding assumptions or interpretations:
- Take their words at face value - avoid reading between the lines
- Use conversation history only to clarify ambiguous references, not to expand scope
- Keep the objective focused and straightforward
- Do NOT add features, analysis, or outcomes the user didn't specifically ask for

## 2. Acceptance Criteria (Key Results)
Define **minimal, specific criteria** that directly address what the user asked for:
- Focus only on what would satisfy their explicit request
- Avoid adding "nice to have" or "comprehensive" requirements
- Keep criteria simple and measurable
- Do NOT expand beyond the user's stated needs

## Context for Planning
Your clarified goal and acceptance criteria will be used by a planner to break down the work into specific tasks. The planner will create concrete, actionable steps based on your clarification, so be specific about what constitutes success.

**Remember:**
- Simplicity over completeness
- User's words over your interpretations
- Explicit requests over implied needs
- Direct answers over comprehensive solutions

Focus strictly on:
- What they explicitly asked for (nothing more, nothing less)
- Any specific targets or subjects they mentioned
- Context from previous conversation that helps clarify ambiguous terms ONLY
- Success criteria that directly fulfill their stated request

Provide both the clarified objective and acceptance criteria in a clear, straightforward format that captures exactly what the user wants.
