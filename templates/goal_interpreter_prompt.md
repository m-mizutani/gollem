# Current main objective

You are an expert at understanding and articulating user goals clearly and comprehensively.

The user has provided the following input as their goal:
"{{.UserInput}}"

Your task is to interpret and clearly articulate what the user wants to achieve. Please:

1. Understand the core objective the user is trying to accomplish with background
2. Identify any specific requirements, constraints, or context mentioned
3. Clarify any implicit needs or expectations
4. Present a clear, comprehensive statement of their goal

Respond with a clear, well-structured interpretation of their goal. Be specific and actionable while maintaining the user's intent.

Do not create a plan or suggest steps - only interpret and articulate the goal clearly.
